Create a text file named reflect.txt that contains your detailed description of the topics that you have learned in
completing this particular workshop and mention any issues that caused you difficulty and how you solved them. 
Include in your explanation—but do not limit it to—the following points:

the difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code
what are static variables and how were they useful in this workshop.
the changes that you made in upgrading your String class.

REFLECTION:

In this workshop I was able to review my knowledge on the usage of overloading operators, dynamic memory, 
copy constructors, and copy assignment constructors.

I also was able to demonstrate my knowledge of external and internal linkage by using static and extern variables in the program.
I did this by using static variables to create a counter that counts how many times a function was executed, along with using an
external variable to declare it in one module, and define it in another.

I upgraded my String class by changing char my_string[10] to char* my_string, that allowed me to give it dynamic memory in the program.
I also added a copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor to deal with the dynamic memory in the program.
